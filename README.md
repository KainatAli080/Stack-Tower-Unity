# Stack Tower ðŸŽ®

A minimalist, fast-paced stacking game built in Unity â€” inspired by *Stack* by Ketchapp â€” where the goal is simple: stack the blocks as high as you can!  
Built as part of a personal game development challenge.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Game
Stack Tower challenges your timing and precision. A moving block slides back and forth across the tower, and your goal is to tap/click at the perfect moment to drop it on top.  
- Perfect alignment = bigger score boost  
- Miss the alignment = block shrinks and the challenge grows  
- Keep stacking until the tower collapses!
